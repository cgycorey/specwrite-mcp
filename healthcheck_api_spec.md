# Healthcheck API Specification

## Product Specification

### Business Value
The healthcheck API provides essential monitoring capabilities for system administrators and DevOps teams to ensure service availability, detect issues early, and maintain system reliability. It enables proactive monitoring, automated alerting, and quick diagnosis of service problems.

### User Stories
- As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health status of the API so that I can ensure the service is running properly and take action if needed
- As a DevOps engineer, I want to receive detailed health information so that I can diagnose issues and troubleshoot problems effectively
- As a monitoring system, I want to check service health programmatically so that I can automate alerting and scaling decisions
- As a security auditor, I want to authenticate healthcheck requests so that I can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive system information

### Acceptance Criteria
#### Basic Healthcheck
- Given the API service is running, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response status code should be 200
- Given the API service is running, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response should contain a JSON object with "status": "ok"
- Given the API service is running, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response should contain a "timestamp" field

#### Detailed Healthcheck
- Given the API service is running, when I send a GET request to "/health?detailed=true", then the response should contain service information
- Given the API service is running, when I send a GET request to "/health?detailed=true", then the response should contain version information
- Given the API service is running, when I send a GET request to "/health?detailed=true", then the response should contain uptime information

#### Error Handling
- Given the API service is running but database is unavailable, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response status code should be 503
- Given the API service is running but database is unavailable, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response should contain "status": "error"
- Given the API service is running but overloaded, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response should contain "status": "degraded"

#### Security
- Given the API service requires authentication for healthcheck, when I send a GET request to "/health" without authentication, then the response status code should be 401
- Given the API service requires authentication for healthcheck, when I send a GET request to "/health" with valid authentication, then the response status code should be 200

#### Rate Limiting
- Given the healthcheck endpoint has rate limiting, when I send more than 10 requests to "/health" within 1 minute, then the response status code should be 429

#### Performance
- Given the API service is running normally, when I send a GET request to "/health", then the response should be received within 500ms

### Success Metrics
- Healthcheck endpoint availability: 99.9%
- Response time under 500ms for 99% of requests
- Proper error codes returned for different failure scenarios
- Authentication bypass attempts blocked 100%
- Rate limiting enforced properly

### Dependencies
- API service must be running and accessible
- Database connectivity (for detailed health information)
- Authentication service (if auth is required)
- Monitoring system integration capabilities

## SpecWrite Feature File

```gherkin
Feature: Healthcheck API
  As a system administrator
  I want to monitor the health status of the API
  So that I can ensure the service is running properly and take action if needed

  Scenario: Basic healthcheck returns OK status
    Given the API service is running
    When I send a GET request to "/health"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain a JSON object with "status": "ok"
    And the response should contain a "timestamp" field

  Scenario: Healthcheck with detailed information
    Given the API service is running
    When I send a GET request to "/health?detailed=true"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain "status": "ok"
    And the response should contain service information
    And the response should contain version information
    And the response should contain uptime information

  Scenario: Healthcheck when database is unavailable
    Given the API service is running but database is unavailable
    When I send a GET request to "/health"
    Then the response status code should be 503
    And the response should contain "status": "error"
    And the response should contain an error message about database connectivity

  Scenario: Healthcheck when service is overloaded
    Given the API service is running but overloaded
    When I send a GET request to "/health"
    Then the response status code should be 503
    And the response should contain "status": "degraded"
    And the response should contain load information

  Scenario: Healthcheck with authentication required
    Given the API service requires authentication for healthcheck
    When I send a GET request to "/health" without authentication
    Then the response status code should be 401
    When I send a GET request to "/health" with valid authentication
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain "status": "ok"

  Scenario: Healthcheck endpoint rate limiting
    Given the healthcheck endpoint has rate limiting
    When I send more than 10 requests to "/health" within 1 minute
    Then the response status code should be 429
    And the response should contain rate limiting information

  Scenario: Healthcheck response time validation
    Given the API service is running normally
    When I send a GET request to "/health"
    Then the response should be received within 500ms
    And the response time should be included in the response headers
```
